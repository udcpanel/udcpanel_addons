# How to Load Temporary Extensions in Firefox

This guide will show you how to load a temporary extension into Firefox for testing or development purposes. Temporary extensions can be loaded directly into Firefox without needing to publish them or sign them.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### Step 1: Open Firefox
- Launch the Firefox browser on your computer.

### Step 2: Go to the Debugging Page
- In the Firefox address bar, type:
- Press **Enter**. This will open the **about:debugging** page, which is where you can manage extensions and view debugging information.

### Step 3: Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
- On the **about:debugging** page, youâ€™ll see a section called **This Firefox**.
- Look for a button labeled **"Load Temporary Add-on..."** and click it.

### Step 4: Select the `manifest.json` File
- A file explorer window will open on your computer.
- Navigate to the folder where your extension files are located.
- Inside the folder, find and select the `manifest.json` file. This file is the main configuration file for your extension.
- Once selected, click **Open** to load the extension.

### Step 5: Verify That the Extension Is Loaded
- After selecting the `manifest.json` file, your extension will appear in the **Temporary Extensions** list on the **about:debugging** page.
- The extension will also be activated in your Firefox browser. You should see it in the browser's toolbar (if it has a browser action) or it will be running in the background depending on how it's configured.

### Step 6: Test and Debug the Extension
- You can now interact with your extension and test it directly in Firefox.
- If there are any issues with the extension, use the **Browser Console** (`Ctrl + Shift + J`) to view any errors or logs that may help with debugging.

### Step 7: Keep in Mind
- **Temporary extensions** will remain active only for the current Firefox session. Once you close Firefox, the extension will be removed.
- This method is perfect for quickly testing and debugging changes during development without needing to publish or sign the extension.

## Notes:
- Temporary extensions are for testing purposes only and will not persist once Firefox is closed.
- If you need your extension to be permanent or want it to be available across Firefox restarts, you will need to package it and submit it to the [Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/).

## Troubleshooting
- If your extension does not appear after loading, make sure that the `manifest.json` file is properly formatted.
- Use the **Browser Console** to check for any errors that may prevent the extension from being loaded.
